            Hi, Iâ€™m <span className="font-semibold">Jose Andhika Putra</span> a
            first-year Information Systems student at IBI Kwik Kian Gie, proudly
            from Indonesia. Iâ€™m passionate about Frontend Development, UI/UX
            design, and game development. One of my biggest dreams is to create
            a popular game either under my own name or through a future game
            studio I build. Right now, Iâ€™m focused on building my personal brand
            while diving deeper into the world of programming.
          </p>

          <p className="leading-relaxed text-justify mt-4">
            My goal is that once Iâ€™ve gained enough knowledge and experience,
            Iâ€™ll share it with the next generation, helping them become more
            aware and ready for the future of technology. When Iâ€™m working or
            learning, I love listening to music from artists and bands like
            Adele, Laufey, Wave to Earth, JKT48, Maroon 5, and many more. If
